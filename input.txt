If you had to sum up George Washington's life in one word, that word would have to be unforgettable. George's story is one of travel and adventure, full of risks and, most of all, full of glory.
   After all, in 1789, he was elected the first president of the United States, a country that was to become the most powerful in the world. At the end of his life, in 1799, George was an international hero.
   But, if you look back into George's early years, you will see that things were not always so rosy. George was sent into the Army as a very young man. For a colonist of his generation, it was a respectable thing to do. It gave him an opportunity to make a living, and at the same time see the country, which at the time was full of wild animals and Indians. It was a tough life, but an interesting one. One could hunt forever in the vast forests. One could explore new lands seemingly forever.
